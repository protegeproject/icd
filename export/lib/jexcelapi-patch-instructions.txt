This folder contains a patch for jexcel api version 2.6.12.

Unfortunately, this library was failing to copy our template file correctly, as it expected every cell in the BiffParser
to have a formula not equal to null. For whatever reason, our template file does not.

To apply the patch, simply download jexcel api version 2.6.12, copy the jexcelapi.patch file to the directory you've
installed it in, and run the following command:

patch -p1 < jexcelapi.patch

After this, simply rebuild using the ant scripts in the build directory.
