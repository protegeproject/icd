Dermatophytosis
Nail
Dermatophytosis (tinea, ringworm) is a superficial infection of the skin, hair or nails with fungi of the genera Microsporum, Trichophyton or Epidermophyton.   These fungi normally invade only the outer keratinous layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum), the hair shaft and the nail.  They count amongst the commonest infections in man.   Some species (e.g. Trichophyton rubrum) are essentially anthropophilic and infect only man whereas others are zoophilic (e.g. Trichophyton verrucosum) but may cause human infection from contact with infected animals.
