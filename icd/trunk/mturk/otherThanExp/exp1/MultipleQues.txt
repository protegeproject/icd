Hidradenitis suppurativa
Dorsal body cavity,Peritoneal cavity,Ventral body cavity,Medullary cavity,Nasal cavity
Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent, painful, deep-seated, rounded nodules and abscesses due to follicular occlusion with secondary inflammation and destruction of the pilo-sebaceo-apocrine apparatus and extension to the adjacent subcutaneous tissue. Subsequent hypertrophic scarring and suppuration of apocrine gland-bearing skin (axillae, groins, peri-anal and perineal regions) are the main clinical features. Infection and hormonal influence are described but are not the primary pathogenetic factor: the exact aetiology remains unknown. Obesity is common and is associated with more severe disease. The main complications are fistulae, arthropathy, carcinoma and amyloidosis.
