Some studies have also reported a distribution of these lesions on keratinized surfaces such as the hard palate and upper surface of the tongue. If ulcerations are noted in these areas, cultures and/or biopsies should be taken from the lesions to rule out viral infections or other causes. Redness and/or ulcerations, ranging from a few millimetres to a few centimetres long, can appear. Bleeding from the ulcerations is common; however, bleeding often reflects a severe reduction in a patient's platelet count, a condition called thrombocytopenia.

Chronic ulcerative stomatitis (CUS) is a rare disease which presents with chronic oral mucosal erosions and ulceration resembling erosive lichen planus but refractory to standard therapies. It typically occurs in older women.  Diagnosis requires the demonstration of speckled granular perinuclear IgG deposits in the basal and parabasal layers of oral epithelium (stratified epithelium-specific antinuclear or SES-ANA pattern).  There is increasing evidence that CUS is an autoimmune disease provoked by circulating IgG antibodies directed against ?Np63?, an isoform of the p53 family of nuclear transcription factors which is present around the nuclei of normal oral epithelial basal keratinocytes.  CUS normally responds to treatment with hydroxychloroquine.
