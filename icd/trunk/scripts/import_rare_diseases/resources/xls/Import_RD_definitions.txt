Prevalence of homozygous forms is estimated at 1/1,000,000. Both sexes are equally affected. Congenital FV deficiency can manifest at any age, with the most severe forms manifesting early in life. Common clinical signs include epistaxis, bruising, mucosal bleeding, soft tissue bleeding, and hemarthrosis. Excessive and prolonged bleeding during or following surgery, delivery or trauma are frequent. Women may present with menorrhagia. In severe forms of the disease, there can be a risk of intracranial, pulmonary or gastrointestinal bleedings. The severity of the bleeding manifestations correlates with the FV levels. Congenital FV deficiency is caused by mutations in the F5 gene (1q23) controlling the production of plasma FV. Transmission is autosomal recessive. Diagnosis is based on prolonged prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times (PT, aPTT) and on low FV levels measured using a PT based assay. The bleeding time (BT) may be prolonged. Molecular testing is available, but unnecessary for diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include factor VIII deficiency, and combined deficiency of factor V and factor VIII (see these terms).

The disease is extremely rare, with only 12 patients from 8 unrelated families reported so far. Nearly all patients with Zap-70 defects presented with typical clinical features of SCID in early life: severe pulmonary infection often sustained by opportunistic pathogens (Pneumocystis carinii), chronic diarrhoea, failure to thrive, and persistent candidiasis. Zap-70 deficiency is ultimately fatal unless patients undergo bone marrow transplantation (BMT). In the future, gene therapy could appear to be an alternative form of treatment. Most of the ZAP-70 gene defects identified in humans prevent protein expression and are concentrated in a region that is critical for stability and enzymatic activity.

Approximately 250 cases have been reported in the literature so far. Clinical manifestations vary widely and include limb defects and visceral malformations (95% of cases), spinal abnormalities, absent diaphragm, bowel atresia and renal agenesis. LBWC generally presents as a short umbilical cord, abdominal placental attachment, persistence of an extraembryonic celom, anorectal malformations, urogenital abnormalities, lumbosacral meningomyelocele and kyphoscoliosis. A spectrum of LBWC manifestations is included in the amniotic band sequence (see this term), presenting mostly with craniofacial defects, facial clefts, amniotic bands and/or adhesions. At present, it remains unclear whether these two entities represent a single disorder. The etiology of LBWC remains unknown. Karyotypes have been reported as normal and no correlations with gender, parental age and teratogenic agents have been found. The principal theories are an extrinsic origin by early amniotic rupture, or a vascular origin due to an early vascular accident during embryological development. Single cases of familial occurrence have been documented. Diagnosis is based on the presenting features. Early antenatal diagnosis is feasible by ultrasound examination and may be followed by medical termination of the pregnancy. LBWC should be differentiated from gastroschisis (see this term), which has better prognosis. LBWC is fatal, with death occurring during antenatally or early in the neonatal period."

This condition is mainly observed in otosclerosis, but is also found in chronic otitis media with tympanosclerosis, and other rare bone diseases such as Paget's disease and osteogenesis imperfecta (Lobstein disease). The prevalence of symptomatic otosclerosis is estimated as 0.1 to 0.5% of the population in the United-States and Western Europe, thus this is not a rare disease. The prevalence of otosclerosis appears to be lower in the Chinese, Japanese, and Latin American populations, and is much lower in the Black population. Tympanosclerosis occurs in 9 to 38% of chronic otitis media cases. The prevalence of Paget's disease associated with temporal bone involvement is estimated as 0.2 to 1% of Caucasian adults. The prevalence of osteogenesis imperfecta is 1/20 000 births. Hearing loss is observed in 26 to 60% of these patients. The etiology of otosclerosis is still unknown. Otosclerosis appears to be a multifactorial disease. Autosomal dominant and a low penetrance (40%) transmission is observed in familial cases. The role of infection with the measles virus as a triggering factor is currently being investigated. Osteogenesis imperfecta is principally related to the mutation of the collagen 1A1 (COL1A1) and 1A2 (COL1A2) genes. The etiology of Paget's disease is still unclear. Tympanosclerosis is a sequela of middle ear chronic inflammation. Otoscopy is normal in otosclerosis, Paget's disease, and osteogenesis imperfecta. It reveals middle ear lesions in tympanosclerosis. Audiometry shows a conductive or mixed hearing loss with abolished stapedial reflexes. Computerised tomography (CT) scanning is crucial for the diagnosis of stapes fixation. It detects the bone lesions of otosclerosis as a hypodense regions mainly localized to the anteriorpart of the oval window. In osteogenesis imperfecta and Paget's disease, lesions involve the whole temporal bone and the skull, and result in thickening of the ossicles. In tympanosclerosis, calcified plaques are typically diffuse in the middle ear cleft and involve the oval window. Differential diagnosis should include minor ossicular malformations presenting with a normal otoscopy, a conductive hearing loss, and abolished stapedial reflexes. In case of otosclerosis, an audiometry with stapedial reflex assessment should be recommended for the parents, siblings, and children (above 20 years of age) of the patient. In all the above etiologies, the progression of the hearing loss is generally slow. The hearing loss due to stapes fixation is rarely profound and should always resolve early during follow-up. The conductive component of the hearing loss can be restored by surgery or hearing aids. The associated sensorineural component is managed by hearing aids or cochlear implants, depending on its severity. Sodium fluoride has been reported to slow the progression of otosclerosis lesions, and the consequent sensorineural hearing loss."
