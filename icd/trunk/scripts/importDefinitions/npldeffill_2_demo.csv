http://who.int/icd#10175_07368d94_d861_421b_b2a0_264c49b96108|A neoplasm composed of spindle to ovoid cells which have morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of follicular dendritic cells. It affects lymph nodes and other sites including the tonsils, gastrointestinal tract, spleen, liver, soft tissues, skin, and oral cavity. It usually behaves as a low grade sarcoma.  Recurrences have been reported in up to half of the cases. Cases which present with abdominal involvement and a high morphologic grade usually have a poorer prognosis.|USA National Cancer Institute
http://who.int/icd#C22.2|A malignant liver neoplasm that occurs almost exclusively in infants, although isolated cases in older children and adults have been reported. Grossly, hepatoblastoma is solid, well circumscribed, and more often solitary than multiple. Microscopically, most of the tumors are composed exclusively of immature hepatocytic elements. About a fourth of hepatoblastomas contain a stromal component that may be undifferentiated or develop into bone or cartilage. |USA National Cancer Institute

PTLDs comprise a spectrum ranging from early, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven polyclonal lymphoid proliferations to EBV-positive or EBV- negative lymphomas of predominantly B-cell or less often T-cell type.

http://who.int/icd#10395_ce88e999_ba9e_41b4_8d8a_b63046b652da|A malignant neoplasm arising from the glandular epithelium of the appendix with invasion of the appendiceal wall beyond the muscularis mucosa. The majority of cases are well differentiated adenocarcinomas with mucinous stroma formation. Clinically, it may present as an abdominal mass or with symptoms of acute appendicitis. Patients with chronic ulcerative colitis are at a higher risk in developing appendiceal adenocarcinomas compared to the general population.|USA National Cancer Institute
http://who.int/icd#C37|Primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm involving the thymus. This category includes malignant thymomas, thymic lymphomas, primary thymic carcinomas, and metastatic carcinomas from other anatomic sites. --2003|USA National Cancer Institute
http://who.int/icd#C85.2|A large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma arising in the mediastinum. Morphologically it is characterized by a massive diffuse lymphocytic proliferation associated with compartmentalizing fibrosis. (WHO, 2001)|USA National Cancer Institute
http://who.int/icd#C86.2|An uncommon mature T-cell lymphoma of intraepithelial lymphocytes. It usually arises from the small intestine, most commonly the jejunum or ileum. Other less frequent primary anatomic sites include the duodenum, stomach, colon, or outside the gastrointestinal tract. It is seen with increased frequency in regions with a high prevalence of celiac disease. The prognosis is poor.|USA National Cancer Institute
http://who.int/icd#3360_ce88e999_ba9e_41b4_8d8a_b63046b652da|A rare glial neoplasm more commonly found in young adults. It is characterized by tumor cells with characteristics suggestive of an astrocytic origin (positive for GFAP), arranged perivascularly. The cells have broad, non-tapering processes radiating towards a central blood vessel. The biologic behavior of astroblastomas is variable, so no WHO grade has been established, yet.

http://who.int/icd#9975_588c79f3_df65_43e0_903d_add110bf20de|A benign histiocytic tumor that occurs during childhood; it is distinct from Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It is characterized by the presence of lipid-laden, foamy histiocytes and Touton-type giant cells in the dermis. The lesions usually develop during infancy. They consist of cutaneous papules and nodules (most often in the head and neck). It is sometimes associated with deep soft tissues nodules.|USA National Cancer Institute
http://who.int/icd#150_52a94b8b_65cc_439a_b8e5_57058c37b3ab|An advanced, invasive breast adenocarcinoma characterized by the presence of distinct changes in the overlying skin. These changes include diffuse erythema, edema, peau d'orange (skin of an orange) appearance, tenderness, induration, warmth, enlargement, and in some cases a palpable mass. The skin changes are the consequence of lymphatic obstruction from the underlying invasive breast adenocarcinoma. Microscopically, the dermal lymphatics show prominent infiltration by malignant cells. The invasive breast adenocarcinoma is usually of ductal, NOS type. There is not significant inflammatory cell infiltrate present, despite the name of this carcinoma.|USA National Cancer Institute

http://who.int/icd#32538_b047675b_e7d6_403d_8ca9_f59ab5570ff4|A malignant, infiltrating mesenchymal tumor arising from the uterine corpus, cervix, vagina, and the ovary. Based on its morphologic characteristics, it is classified as either a low grade or an undifferentiated (high grade) stromal sarcoma. The low grade endometrioid stromal sarcoma is characterized by the presence of oval to spindle-shape cells that resemble the cells of the endometrial stroma, without evidence of significant atypia and pleomorphism. Numerous small vessels are also present. The undifferentiated stromal sarcoma is characterized by an aggressive clinical course, the presence of significant cellular atypia, pleomorphism, and high mitotic activity.|USA National Cancer Institute
