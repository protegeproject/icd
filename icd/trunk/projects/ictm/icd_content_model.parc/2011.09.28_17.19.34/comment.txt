- Added a subclass of LinearizationSpecification called HistoricLinearizationSpecification 
- Added historicLinearization property and set its domain to LinearizationSection and its range to HistoricLinearizationSpecification.
- Added sub-properties of the historicLinearization property (icd10Linearization and icd10TabulationList), to allow representation of linearizations that encode ICD-10 tabulation lists and ICD-10 (or ICD-9) national modifications.
- Added more LinearizationView instances:
    - 6 for the ICD-10 Special Tabulation Lists (M1, M2, M3, M4, Mb, and VA).
    - 6 for historic ICD-10 linearizations (
    - 2 new ICD11 linearizations by splitting the Primary Care linearizations into high and low resource settings
- Added a boolean datatype property called "isObsolete", with the domain "DefinitionSection"

- Created 3 subclasses of "LinearizationView" ("ICD11LinearizationView", "ICD10LinearizationView", and "ICD10TabulationListView") and reorganized its instances into these subclasses. Removed class definition axiom from "LinearizationView".
