Sclerodactyly

Sclerodactyly is a morphological term used to describe thickening and sclerosis of the skin and soft tissues of the fingers with resultant limitation of movement and joint contractures.  In severe cases ulceration may occur.  It is typically seen in autoimmune disorders including limited systemic sclerosis (CRST syndrome), diffuse systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue disease, in which case it is likely to be associated with Raynaud phenomenon.  It may also be associated, however, with long-standing diabetes (diabetic cheiroarthropathy), exposure to certain drugs and or chemicals, in hand-arm vibration syndrome and in a number of rare genetic syndromes.

Dermatomyositis
Body Regions,Bones,Muscles,Nerve,Blood Vessels,Body Tissues
Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy, showing progressive, symmetrical muscle weakness, low muscle endurance, and cutaneous manifestations such as Gottron’s papules, heliotrope rash, shawl sign, V-sign and mechanic’s hand. Internal organ manifestations such as interstitial pneumonia and myocarditis sometimes develop. The skin rash may precede the muscle symptoms and may be the only clinical sign of dermatomyositis in some patients (clinically, amyopathic dermatomyositis).
