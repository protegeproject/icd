Sclerodactyly
Upper Extremity
Sclerodactyly is a morphological term used to describe thickening and sclerosis of the skin and soft tissues of the fingers with resultant limitation of movement and joint contractures.  In severe cases ulceration may occur.  It is typically seen in autoimmune disorders including limited systemic sclerosis (CRST syndrome), diffuse systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue disease, in which case it is likely to be associated with Raynaud phenomenon.  It may also be associated, however, with long-standing diabetes (diabetic cheiroarthropathy), exposure to certain drugs and or chemicals, in hand-arm vibration syndrome and in a number of rare genetic syndromes.
