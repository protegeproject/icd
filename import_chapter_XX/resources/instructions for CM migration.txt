Note: If not otherwise specified all class, property and individual names 
	are in the "http://who.int/icd#" namespace

Create subclass of ReferenceTerm:
- ICD10ReferenceTerm
	add rdfs:label "ICD-10 Reference Term"
	add rdfs:comment "Reference Term pointing to an ICD-10 category (available for example in BioPortal)."
	??? should we add other superclasses also (such as DefiningTerm or LanguageTerm)?
	
Note: Why is SpecificConditionTerm not a subclass of DefiningTerm also? 
	(Neither is SnomedReferenceTerm, but I suppose that may be fine) 

Create new object property 
- icd10Reference
	set rdfs:label to "icd10Reference"
	add rdfs:comment "This property can be used to create external references to ICD-10 categories (available in BioPortal) that correspond to the new External Causes and Injuries categories."
	set domain to ExternalCauseSection
	set range to ICD10ReferenceTerm



!!! BEFORE starting the ImportChapterXX migration application 
make sure to move all subclasses of XX under Retired!
